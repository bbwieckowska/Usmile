\title{Balanced Test Set for the Heart Disease Dataset}
\format{
A data frame with 330 rows and 56 columns. The format and variables are identical to \code{\link{heart_disease}}.
}
\usage{
heart_disease_test
}
\description{
A balanced stratified subset of the complete \code{heart_disease} dataset, intended for model testing and validation.
Contains 330 complete cases with approximately equal distribution of disease cases.
This set is complementary to \code{heart_disease_train} and together they form the complete dataset.
All variables, both real and generated, are identical to those described in \code{heart_disease}.

\examples{
data(heart_disease_test)
data(heart_disease_train)
# Train a model on the training set and predict on the test set
model <- glm(disease ~ age + chol, data = heart_disease_train, family = "binomial")
predictions <- predict(model, newdata = heart_disease_test, type = "response")
